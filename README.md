## NI VeriStand FPGA Project Tool ##

**NI VeriStand FPGA Project Tool** guides one through the process of selecting the FPGA and any C-Series modules that may be contained within a cRIO or C-Series Expansion Chassis. It operates similar to the wizard for starting a new LabVIEW FPGA Project except that it adds the necessary components to the project for a custom FPGA to be used with NI VeriStand. The project wizard adds a framework template, DMA FIFOs, and corresponding XML file to begin development. It also saves the project and files to a location specified by the user.

After installing the NI VeriStand FPGA Support, NI VeriStand RIO Library will appear on the FPGA functionâ€™s palette. The NI VeriStand RIO Library was created so that creating a custom FPGA bitfile for NI VeriStand will be less cumbersome and not require LabVIEW FPGA expertise. Each C-Series module with the exception of communication modules (CAN, Profibus, etc.), motion modules, removable storage modules, and some third-party modules has been included in the NI VeriStand RIO Library. The modules are separated between Basic I/O and Special Case I/O. You can drop these VIs into the template and wire them up directly to DMA.

### LabVIEW Version ###

LabVIEW 2010

### Quality, Limitations ###

This code was developed in 2011 and has been in use worldwide since then. It should be considered mature and high quality. However, the installer is a bit strange, and ideally it would be redeveloped to use VI package manager. Additionally, the example is installed into user.lib, which is wrong.
